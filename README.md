This repo contains:   

- The slides about WHY Open Science by Alfredo Sánchez-Tójar. (`Towards_open_reliable_and_transparent_science.pdf`).  

- The slides to exemplify how to ensure our projects are Open, Reliable (i.e. reproducible and well documented) and Transparent by Nacho Bartomeus (`ORT_Science.qmd / .html`).

Ignasi Bartomeus is in debt with Paco Rodriguez and many others that shared their wisdom.
