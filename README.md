# Open, Reliable and Transparent Science

This repo contains the slides to exemplify how to ensure our projects are Open, Reliable (i.e. reproducible and well documented) and Transparent. 

This slides where first used in a AEET-SORTEE workshop co-organized with Alfredo Sanchez-Tojar for AEET 2023 meeting in Almeria.

The slides are developed by Ignasi Bartomeus, which is in debt with Paco Rodriguez and many others that shared their wisdom.
